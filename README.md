# **FoodSpicious Application**

## _Introduction_
This application is the final version of the SEF laboratory project.
During the development of this application we have encountered many issues and learned
many things as well.

## _Java FX_
Java FX is a software framework for delivering UI desktop applications. It is the newest alternative to Java Swing.
This demo project used as inspiration the [official Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/form.htm).

##_PostgresSQL_
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

##_ElephantSql_
This site has hosted our database.

##_Junit (jupiter)_
This is the framework that we have sued to test our application.

##_Github_

For the version control system, we have chosen Github because it was the one we were most used to.
## Issue Tracking
For the purpose of demonstrating a complete Agile Workflow, we created a Jira instance that you can find [here](https://sef-application.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/FOOD/boards/4/backlog)
. You will need to use the ID's of the User Stories created there in your commit messages.

## _Happy Coding_
Coding is always nice!
